# 2.2 Processing Services (Higher-Order Business Logic)

## 2.2.0 Introduction
Processing services are the layer where a higher order of business logic is implemented. they may combine (or orchestrate) two primitive-level functions from their corresponding foundation service to introduce a newer functionality. they may also call one primitive function and change the outcome with a little bit of added business logic. and sometimes processing services are there as a pass-through to introduce balance to the overall architecture.

Processing services are optional, depending on your business need - in a simple CRUD operations API, processing services and all the other categories of services beyond that point will sieze to exist as there is no need for a higher order of business logic at that point.

Here's an example of what a Processing service function would look like:

```csharp
public ValueTask<Student> UpsertStudentAsync(Student student) =>
TryCatch(async () => 
{
    ValidateStudent(student);
    
    IQueryable<Student> allStudents = 
        this.studentService.RetrieveAllStudents();
    
    bool isStudentExists = allStudents.Any(retrievedStudent => 
        retrievedStudent.Id == student.Id);

    return isStudentExsits switch {
        false => await this.studentService.RegisterStudentAsync(student),
        _ => await this.studentService.ModifyStudentAsync(student.Id)
    };
});
```

Processing services make Foundation services nothing but a layer of validation on top of the existing primitive operations. Which means that Processing services functions are beyond primitive, and they only deal with local models as we will discuss in the upcoming sections.

## 2.2.1 On The Map
When used, Processing services live between foundation services and the rest of the application. they may not call Entity or Business brokers, but they may call Utility brokers such as logging brokers, time brokers and any other brokers that offer supporting functionality and not specific to any particular business logic. here's a visual of where processing services are located on the map of our architecture:

    </p>
<br />

On the right side of a Processing service lies all the non-local models and functionality, whether it's through the brokers, or the models that the foundation service is trying to map into local models.
On the left side of Processing services is pure local functionality, models and architecture. Starting from the Processing services themselves, there should be no trace or track of any native or non-local models in the system.

## 2.2.2 Charachteristics
Processing services in general are combiners of multiple primitive-level functions to produce a higher-order business logic. but they have much more charactristics than just that, let's talk about those here.

### 2.2.2.0 Language
The language used in processing services define the level of complexity and the capabilities it offers.
Usually, processing services combine two or more primitive operations from the foundation layer to create a new value.

#### 2.2.2.0.0 Functions Language
At a glance, Processing services language change from primitive operations such as `AddStudent` or `RemoveStudent` to `EnsureStudentExists` or `UpsertStudent`. they usually offer a more advanced business-logic operations to support a higher order functionality.
Here's some examples for the most common combinations a processing service may offer:

| Processing Operation					|   Primitive Functions		                                | 
|------------------------				|-----------------------------------                        |
| EnsureStudentExistsAsync				| RetrieveAllStudents + AddStudentAsync                     | 
| UpsertStudentAsync				    | RetrieveStudentById + AddStudentAsync + ModifyStudentAsync|
| VerifyStudentExists					| RetrieveAllStudents 								        |
| TryRemoveStudentAsync				    | RetrieveStudentById + RemoveStudentByIdAsync 				|

As you can see, the combination of primitive functions processing services do might also include adding an additional layer of logic on top of the existing primitive operation. For instance, `VerifyStudentExists` takes advantage of the `RetrieveAllStudents` primitive function, and then adds a boolean logic to verify the returned student by and Id from a query actually exists or not before returning a `boolean`.

#### 2.2.2.0.1 Pass-Through
Processing services may borrow some of the terminology a foundation service may use. for instance, in a pass-through scenario, a processing service with be as simple as `AddStudentAsync`. we will discuss the architecture-balancing scenarios later in this chapter.
Unlike Foundation services, Processing services are required to have the identifer `Processing` in their names. for instance, we say `StudentProcessingService`.

#### 2.2.2.0.2 Class-Level Language
More importantly Processing services must include the name of the entity that is supported by their corresponding Foundation service.
For instance, if a Processing service is dependant on a `TeacherService`, then the Processing service name must be `TeacherProcessingService`.

### 2.2.2.1 Dependencies
Processing services can only have two types of dependencies. a corresponding Foundation service, or a Utility broker. that's simply because Processing services are nothing but an extra higher-order level of business logic, orchestrated by combined primitive operations on the Foundation level.
Processing services can also use Utility brokers such as `TimeBroker` or `LoggingBroker` to support it's reporting aspect. but it shall never interact with an Entity or Business broker.

### 2.2.2.2 One-Foundation
Processing services can interact with one and only one Foundation service. In fact without a foundation service there can never be a Processing layer. and just like we mentioned above about the language and naming, Processing services take on the exact same entity name as their Foundation dependency.
For instance, a processing service that handles higher-order business-logic for students will communicate with nothing but its foundation layer, which would be `StudentService` for instance. That means that processing services will have one and only one service as a dependency in its construction or initiation as follows:

```csharp
public class StudentProcessingService
{
    private readonly IStudentService studentService;

    public StudentProcessingService(IStudentService studentService) =>
        this.studentService = studentService;
}
```
However, processing services may require dependencies on multiple utility brokers such as `DateTimeBroker` or `LoggingBroker` ... etc.

### 2.2.2.3 Used-Data-Only Validations
Unlike the Foundation layer services, Processing services only validate what it needs from it's input. For instance, if a Processing service is required to validate a student entity exists, and it's input model just happens to be an entire `Student` entity, it will only validate that the entity is not `null` and that the `Id` of that entity is valid. the rest of the entity is out of the concern of the Processing service.
Processing services delegate full validations to the layer of services that is concerned with that which is the Foundation layer.
Processing services are also not very concerned about outgoing validations except for what it's going to use within the same routine. For instance, if a Processing service is retrieving a model, and it's going to use this model to be passed to another primitive-level function on the Foundation layer, the Processing service will be required to validate that the retrieved model is valid depending on which attributes of the model it uses.
