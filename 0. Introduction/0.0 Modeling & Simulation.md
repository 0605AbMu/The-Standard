# 0.0 Purposing, Modeling and Simulation

## 0.0.0 Introduction
The Standard defines the process of software engineering in three main categories. Purposing, Modeling and Simulation. Each one of these aspects plays a crucial role in guiding the efforts of engineering towards producing a successful solution and fulfilling a particular purpose.

The order in which these aspects are followed is also intentional. A purpose must exist to shape the modeling process. And one can't simulate interactions with no models. But while that order at the initiation of the engineering process is crucial, It's important to understand that the process itself is selectively iterative. A change in the prupose may reflect as a change in the simulation but not necessarily the modeling. A change in the models may not neccessarily require a change in either the purpose nor the simulation.

## 0.0.1 Purposing
The purposing process is our ability to find out *why* we need a solution. For instance, if we are having an issue with knowing how many items are on the shelf in some grocery store. We deem the manual process of counting to be inefficient and a system needs to be put in place to ensure we have the proper count of items.

Purposing therefore, is to find a reason to take an action. Reasoning relies heavily on observability. Our ability to observe problems and then being able to articulate the problem to better device a solution that addresses the given problem.

So, we have the observation, the articulation of the reasoning (the problem) and the intent for a solution. All of these aspects constitute the Purposing portion of engineering software.

### 0.0.1.0 Observation
We live in a world full of observables. Our inspiration is triggered by our ambition to achieve more. Our dreams reveal blockers in our way that we need to solve to continue our journey and fulfill our dreams. From the moment a young student uses a calculator to solve a complex equation to the moment that very student becomes an astronaut, calculatoring the trajectory of satellites orbiting our planet.

Observation is our ability to detect an issue that's blocking a gaol from being achieved. Issues can be as simple as coming up with the proper count of items on a grocery store shelf. All the way up to understanding why we can't capture images of planets millions of light years away from us. These are all what engineers would describe an observable problem.

The greater the purpose, the more complex a problem is going to be. But these smaller purposes are our way to train our minds to tackle bigger ones. Step by step, one problem at a time.

### 0.0.1.1 Articulation
Describing the observable is an art in and of itself. Because describing a problem properly is half way to its solution. The clearer the articulation of the problem is, the more likely the problem is to be understood by others helping us to solve that very same problems.

Articulation isn't always with words. It's also with figures and shapes. It is not an accident that some of the most advanced ancient cultures have used figures and shapes to describe their times and their history. Figures are a universal language, understood and interpreted by anyone who could relate to them much faster than learning a spoken language. In fact, a figure or shape might be the most optimum way to illustrate an idea as it pictures are worthy of thousands of words.

Articulation requires the passion to solve the issue. Whether it's written, said or illustrated. A passionate mind shall convey the hidden message of the criticality of the problem to be solved. Articulating a problem is a big part of how one can sell their solution. Our ability to convey an idea towards other engineers and then those who will be investing and using this solution is one of the most important aspects of engineering software.

### 0.0.1.2 Solutioning
A part of the purpose is the way to fulfil it. In the engineering industry, fulfilling the goals can't just be by -any- means. A huge aspect of why so many massive pieces of software fails around the world is because the solutioning aspect was overlooked as a trivial part of the purpose. You may have heard of those who were pressured against a deadline so they decided to cut corners to achieve the goal. In our Standard, this is a violation. A solution *must* be not just fulfilling to a goal, but it must be a purpose in and of itself. This is in terms of optimization, readability, configurability and longevity. Solutioning as part of the purpose is software craftmanship.
