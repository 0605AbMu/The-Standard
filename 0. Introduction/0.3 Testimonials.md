# 0.3 Testimonials
This chapter is about testimonials from engineers all over the world. They have all used The Standard in their daily projects and benefited from it. Here's their testimonials:

---

<i>"The Standard is free knowledge, it taught me things about Software engineering more than school.
Knowing the correct naming conventions and keeping a virtual code map in your head is really helpful.
You know in your head (UI/API -> Service -> Broker -> Database)
It made me know what I want to do and draw my architecture before I start writing code. Knowing what is where is very important here.
It is blazor friendly and I have adapted most of the standard basics in my Pre-Master Graduation project. 
I intend to learn the Standard as I see it evolve and adapt more libraries and I love the idea of Hassan creating his own Dotnet Libraries.
I am still learning the standard, But I hope one day I fully adapt it in one of my big projects and libraries." </i>

<i> "The Standard takes out the ambiguity that comes with writing code. It takes into consideration many edge cases and threats which go unseen so many times in SDL. It is developer friendly and gives the flexibility of anyone working on any service/product if it uses The Standard. My team can take vacation and the work will still go on as if that same engineer is writing the code." </i>
