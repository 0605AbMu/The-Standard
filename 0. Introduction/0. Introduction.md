# Introcution

This is The Standard. A collection of decades of experience in the engineering industry. I authored it for you to find your way in the wide ocean of knowledge. The Standard is not perfect, and never will be. It reflects the ongoing evolution in the engineering industry. Whilst it may be written by one person, it is actually the collection of thoughts from hundreds of engineers that I've had the honor to interact with throughtout my life and learn from.
