# 0.0 The Theory

## 0.0.0 Introduction
When designing any system, it is of utmost importance for the designer to backup their design with a certain theory. Theories play a massive role in ensuring the purposes, models and simulations of their design are cohesive and extensible within a certain domain.

Any system out there regardless of how chaotic it may seem is mandatorily influenced by at least one theory either coined by the designer or inherited from previous designers or their systems.

Regardless of what or who the influencer may be, it is important for the designer to fully understand the theory they follow or it will negatively impact their future decisions in terms of extending their design to keep up with a forever changing and expanding universe.

I have realized early on that the simpler any theory is, the easier it becomes for other designers to adapt the theory and extend it's reach beyond the original designer's dreams. A universe built on top of simpler patterns can make it a lot easier for those who marvel at its beauty to better understand it and appreciate it much more than those who just give-in to the fact that it's complex beyond their comprehension.

A theory about the universe could make life much more purposeful, enriched with all sorts of tales about survival, evolution and fulfillment.


## 0.0.1 Finding Answers
Early on in my life, I struggled with schooling. Nothing that was taught made any sense to me. It seemed that everyone at school was more concerned with memorizing and regurgitating what they've memorized during their exam than truly understanding consciously what was being taught and question it's origins and validate it's purposes.

I realized at an earlier age that I needed some magical equation to help me distinguish between what's true and what's not. What's right and wrong. What's driven by a purpose and what's an imitation for those who have true purposes.

So, I started my search in coming up with a theory that can explain the world to me. I was named all kinds of names during my schooling years. But I didn't mind much of that because my heart, mind and body were fully invested into finding the answer to everything.

When looking for answers, it's important to keep your heart and mind open for all the options. Don't let any social or traditional structures limit your mind from seeking the truth about the universe and embracing the answers from everywhere.

After years and years of search, I settled on a theory that made it simple for a simple person like myself to understand everything. I called it The Tri-Nature of Everything.


## 0.0.2 Tri-Nature
Everything around us has a purpose. It was created and designed with a certain reason in the mind of it's creator. We design cars to take us from point A to point B. We design cups for drinking, plates for eating and shoes for walking. Everything in existence has a core purpose the governs it's design and legitimatizes it's existence.

But every system out there must have a dependency in one form or another. For instance, we as biological systems rely on food and water to survive. Cars rely on oil or electricity. Computer systems rely on power and electricity and so on. Every system no matter how small or big it may be, and regardless of it's impact and importance must have a dependency of some kind.

But in order for a dependency to become a dependency it needs to expose itself somehow for other systems to rely on it. For instance, power outlets are an exposure layer for power sources to allow other systems to plug in and consume its services. Gas stations are exposure layers for oil tanks buried underground to store that oil. And so on with every system out there it needs to expose itself to allow other systems to integrate with it and consume its capabilities.
